# 🔐 Password Generator for MICRO IT 

A  **Password Generator** is a tool that creates strong, random passwords based on user-specified criteria. This Python-based project allows users to customize their passwords by selecting the desired length and choosing whether to include:

- ✅ Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- ✅ Lowercase letters (a-z)
- ✅ Digits (0-9)
- ✅ Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)

The generated passwords are highly secure, making them ideal for protecting online accounts and sensitive data.



## 🧠 Key Features

- 📏 Adjustable password length (4–32 characters)
  
- 🎚️ Interactive checkboxes for character selection
  
- 🔁 Instant password generation with one click
  
- ⚠️ Validates user input to ensure at least one character type is selected
  
- 💻 Built using Python and `ipywidgets` for an interactive interface in Google Colab
